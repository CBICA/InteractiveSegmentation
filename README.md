### Summary

The proposed IML-based segmentation method offers the capability to derive patient-specific machine learning models, resulting in annotations comparable to, and in some cases better than, expert-drawn manual annotations, both in terms of accuracy and consistency, while offering a significant gain in speed. Quantitative evaluation in multiple anatomical structures supports this method’s generalizability and promise for real-world application, facilitating faster generation of expert annotations
